# Ruby Notebooks

A series of Jupyter notebooks for learning the Ruby programming language.

## IRuby

You can follow these notebooks without installing [`iruby`](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby) on your computer by using the Interactive Ruby environment [`irb`](https://github.com/ruby/irb).

But if you prefer using Jupyter, you can follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby#installation) for installing `iruby` and register a Ruby kernel for your Jupyter notebooks.

## Notebooks
