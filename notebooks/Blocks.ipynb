    "# Blocks in Ruby\n",
    "\n",
    "Ruby Code blocks (called _closures_ in other languages) are definitely one of the coolest features of Ruby and are chunks of code between braces or between `do..end` that you can associate with _method_ invocations, almost as if they were parameters. A Ruby block is a way of grouping statemetns, and may appear only in the source _adjacent to a method call_; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list). The code in the block is not executed at the time it is encountered. Instead, Ruby remembers the context in which the blocks appears (the local variables, the current object, and so on) and then enters the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ruby standard is to use braces for single-line blocks and `do..end` for multi-line blocks. Keep in mind that the braces syntax has a higher precedence than the `do..end` syntax. Braces have a high precedence; `do` has a low precedence. If the method invocation has parameters that are not enclosed in parentheses, the brace form of a block will bind to the last parameter, not to the overall invocation. The `do` form will bind to the invocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matz says that _any method_ can be called with blocks as an implicit argument. Inside the method, you can call the block using the `yield` keyword with a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as you will soon learn, blocks can have their own arguments. There are many methods in Ruby that iterate over a range of values. Most of these iterators are written in such a way as to be able to take a code block as part of the calling syntax. The method can then yiled control to the code block (i.e. execute the block) during execution as many times as is necessary for the iteration to complete (e.g. if we are iterating over array values, we can execute the block as many times as there are array values etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created a block, you can associate it with a call to a method. Usually the code blocks passed into methods are anonymous objects, created on the spot. For example, in the following code, the block containing `puts \"Hello\"` is associated with the call to a method `greet`."
