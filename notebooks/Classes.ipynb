    "\n",
    "So far, the procedural style of programmimg (this continues to be used in languages such as C) was used to write our programs. Programming procedurally means you focus on the steps required to complete a task without paying particular attention to how the data is managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Object-Orientation style, objects are your agents, your proxies, in the universe of your program. You ask them for information. You assign them tasks to accomplish. You tell them to perform calculations and report back to you. You hand them to each other and get them to work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you design a class, think about the objects that will be created from that class type. Think about the things the object **knows** and the this the object **does**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things an objects **knows** about itself are called _instance_ variables. They represent an object's state (the data - for example, the quantity and the product id), and can have unique values for each object of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things an object ca **do** are called methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An object is an entity that serves as a container for data and also controls access to the data. Associated with an object is a set of attributes, which are essentially no more than variables belonging to that object. Also associated with an object is a set of functions that provide an interface to the functionality of the object, called methods. - Hal Fulton\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a combination of state and methods that use the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence a class is used to construct an object. A class is a blueprint for an object. For example, you might use a Button class to make dozens of different buttons, and each button might have its own color, size, shape, label and so on. An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read this very carefully, it's a brain bender!**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Classes in Ruby are first-class objects - each is an instance of class `Class`. When a new class is defined (typically using `class Name` ... `end`), an object of type `Class` is created and assigned to a constant (`Name` in this case). When `Name.new` is called to create a new object, the `new` class method in `Class` is run by default, which in turn invokes `allocate` to allocate memory for the object, before finally calling the new object's `initialize` method.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The constructing and initializing phases of an object are separate and both can be overridden. The construction is done via the `new` class method, the initialization is done via the `initialize` instance method. `initialize` is not a constructor!\n",
    "\n",

    "## Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a class method is that you send a message to the object that is the class rather than to one of the class's instances. Class methods serve a purpose. Some operations pertaining to a class can't be performed by individual instances of that class. `new` is an excellent example. We call `Dog.new` because, until we've created an individual dog instance, we can't send it any messages! Besided, the job of spawning a new object logically belongs to the class. It doesn't make sense for instances of `Dog` to spawn each other. It does make sense, however, for the instance-creation process to be centralized as an activity of the class `Dog`. It's vital to understand that by `Dog.new`, we have a method that we can access through the class object `Dog` but not through its instances. Individual dog objects (instances of the class `Dog`) do not have this method. A class object (like `Dog`) has its own methods, its own state, its own identity. It doesn't share these things with instances of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Dog#bark` - the instance method `bark` in the class `Dog`.\n",
    "`Dog.color` - the class method `color`, in the class `Dog`.\n",
    "`Dog::color` - another way to refer to the class method `color`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In writting about Ruby, the _pound notation_ (#) is sometimes used to indicate an instance method - for example, we say `File.chmod` to denote the class method `chmod` of class `File`, and `File#chmod` to denote the instance method that has the same name. **This notation is not part of Ruby syntax**.\n",
