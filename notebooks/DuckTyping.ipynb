    "# Duck Typing in Ruby\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have noticed that in Ruby we don't declare the types of variables or methods - everything is just some kind of object. Ruby objects (unlike objects in some other object-oriented languages) can be individually modified. You can always add methods on a per object basis. In Ruby, the behavior or capabilities of an object can deviate from those supplied by its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Ruby, we rely less on the type (or class) of an object and more on its capabilities.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Hence, Duck Typing means an object type is defined by what it can do, not by what it is. Duck Typing refers to the tendency of Ruby to be less concerned with the class of an object and more concerned with what methods can be called on it and what operations can be performed on it.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In Ruby, we would use `respond_to?` or might simply pass an object to a method and know that an exception will be raised if it is used inappropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an object walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then the Ruby interpreter is happy to treat it as if it were a duck.\n",
