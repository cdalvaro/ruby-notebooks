    "When you send a message to an object, the object executes the first method it finds on its [method lookup path](http://phrogz.net/RubyLibs/RubyMethodLookupFlow.pdf) with the same name as the message. If it fails to find any such method, it raises a `NoMethodError` exception - unless you have provided the object with a method called `method_missing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `method_missing` method is passed the symbol of the non-existent method, an array of the arguments that were passed in the original call and any block passed to the original method.\n",
    "\n",
    "`method_missing` is in part a safety net: It gives you a way to interpret unanswerable messages and handle them gracefully."
