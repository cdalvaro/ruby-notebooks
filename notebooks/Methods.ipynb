Those without the bang perform an action and return a freshly minted object, reflecting the results of the action (capitalizing a string, sorting an array, and so on).

    "\n",
    "The question mark has no special meaning to the Ruby interpreter. However, by convention, any method whose name ends with `?` returns a valur that answers the question posed by the method invocation. The `empty?` method of an array, for example, returns `true` if the array has no elements. Mostly such methods returns one of the Boolean values `true` or `false`, but this is not required, as any value other than `false` or `nil` works like `true` when a Boolean value is required. The `Numeric` method `nonzero?`, for example, return `nil` if the number it is invoked on is zero, and just returns the number otherwise."
