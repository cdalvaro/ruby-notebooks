Uppercase letter means \"A\" through \"Z\", and digit means \"0\" through \"9\". A name is an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or an underscore (\"\\_\"), followed by _**Name characters**_ (this is any combination of upper- and lowercase letters, underscore and digits)."

    "Variables in Ruby can contain data of any type. You can use variables in your Ruby programs _without any declarations_. Variable name itself denotes its scope (local, global, instance, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **local** variable (declared within an object) name consists of a lowercase letter (or an underscore) followed by name characters (`sunil`, `_z`, `hit_and_run`).\n",
    "- An **instance** variable (declared within an object always \"belongs to\" whatever object **`self`** refers to) name starts with an \"at\" sign (\"`@`\") followed by a name (`@sign`, `@_`, `@Counter`).\n",
    "- A **class** variable (declared within a class) name starts with two \"at\" signs (\"`@@`\") followed by a name (`@@sign`, `@@_`, `@@Counter`). A class variable is shared among all objects of a class. Only one copy of a particular class variable exists for a given class. Class variables used at the top level are defined in **Object** and behave like global variables. _Class variables are rarely used in Ruby programs_.\n",
    "- **Global** variables start with a dollar sign (\"`$`\") followed by name characters. A global variable name can be formed using \"`$-`\" followed by any single character (`$counter`, `$COUNTER`, `$-x`). Ruby defines a number of global variables that include other punctuation characters, such as `$_` and `$-K`."
