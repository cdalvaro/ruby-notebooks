    "# Numbers in Ruby\n",

    "Let's play with Numbers. In Ruby, numbers without decimal points are called integers, and numbers with decimal points are usually called floating-point numbers or, more simply, floats (you must place at least one digit before the decimal point). An integer literal is simply a sequence of digits eg. `0`, `123`, `123456789`. Underscores may be inserted into integer literals (though not at the beginning or end), and this feature is sometimes used as a thousands separator eg. `1_000_000_000`. Underscore characters are ignored in the digit string."

Ruby does this with different classes, one called `Fixnum` (default) that represents easily managed smaller numbers, and another, aptly called `Bignum`, that represents \"big\" numbers Ruby needs to manage internally. Ruby will handle Bignums and Fixnums for you, and you can perform arithmetic and other operations without any problems. Results might vary depending on your system's architecture, but as these changes are handled entirely by Ruby, there's no need to worry."
