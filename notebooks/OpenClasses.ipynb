    "> If you're writing a new method that conceptually belongs in the original class, you can reopen the class and append your method to the class definition. You should only do this if your method is generally useful, and you're sure it won't conflict with a method defined by some library you include in the future. If your method isn't generally useful, or you don't want to take the risk of modifying a class after its initial creation, create a subclass of the original class. The subclass can override its parent's methods, or add new ones. This is safer because the original class, and any code that depended on it, is unaffected."
