    "# Regular Expressions in Ruby\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions, though cryptic, is a powerful tool for worjing with text. Ruby has this feature built-in. It's used for pattern-matching and text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people find regular expressions difficult to use, difficult to read, un-maintainable, and ultimately couterproductive. You may end up using only a modest number of regular expressions in your Ruby and Rails applications. Becoming recular expressions wizard isn't a prerequisite for Rails programming. _However, it's advisable to learn at least the basics of how regular expressions work_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A regular expression is simply a way of specifying a pattern of characters to be matched in a string**. In Ruby, you tipically create a regular expression by writting a pattern between slash characters ('/pattern/').\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ruby, regular expressions are objects (of type `Regexp`) and can be manipulated as such. `//` is a regular expression and an instance of the `Regexp` class, as shown bellow."

    "\n",
    "The simplest way to find out whether there's a match between a pattern and a string is with the `match` method. You can do this in either direction: Regular expression objects and string objects both responds to `match`. If there's no match, you get back `nil`. If there's a match, it returns an instance of the class `MatchData`. We can also use the match operator `=~` to match a string against a regular expression. If the pattern is found in the string, `=~` returns its starting position, otherwise it returns `nil`."
