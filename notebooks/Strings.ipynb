    "# Strings in Ruby\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods in the **`String`** class like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`reverse`** that gives a backwards version of the string (`reverse` does not change the original string).\n",
    "- **`length`** that tells us the number of characters (including spaces) in the string.\n",
    "- **`upcase`** changes every lowercase letter to uppercase, and **`downcase`** changes every uppercase letter to lowercase.\n",
    "- **`swapcase`** switches the case of every letter in the string.\n",
    "- **`capitalize`** is just like `downcase`, except that it switches the first character to uppercase (if it is a letter).\n",
    "- **`slice`** gives you a substring of a larger string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods `upcase`, `downcase`, `swapcase` and `capitalize` have corresponding methods that modify a string in place rather than creating a new one: `upcase!`, `downcase!`, `swapcase!` and `capitalize!`. Assuming you don't need the original string, these methods will save memory, specially if the string is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that `String` literals are sequences of characters between singles or double quotation marks. The difference between the two forms is the amount of processing Ruby does on the string while constructiong the literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _**single-quoted**_ case, Ruby does very little:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The backslash works to escape another backslash, so that the second backslash is not itself interpreted as an escape character.\n",
    "  - A backslash is not special if the character that follows it is anything other than a quote or a backslash. For example, `a\\b` and `a\\\\b` are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _**double-quoted**_ case, Ruby does more work:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. It looks for substitutions - sequences that start with a backslash character - and replaces them with some binary value.\n",
    "  2. Expression interpolation. Within the string, the sequence `#{expression}` is replaced by the value of expression."
