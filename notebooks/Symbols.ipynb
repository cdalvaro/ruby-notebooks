    "A symbol looks like a variable name but it's prefixed with a colon. Examples - `:action`, `:line_items`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to pre-declare a symbol and they are guaranteed to be unique. There's no need to assign some kind of value to a symbol - Ruby takes care of that for you. Ruby also guarantees that no matter where it appears in your program, a particular symbol will have the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can consider the colon to mean \"thing named\" so `:id` is \"the thing named id\". You can also think of `:id` as meaning the name of the variable id, and plain `id` as meaning the value of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **Symbol** is the most basic Ruby object you can create. It's just a name and an internal ID. Symbols are useful because a given symbol name refers to the same object throughout a Ruby program. Symbols are more efficient than strings. Two strings with the same contents are two different objects, but for any given name there is only one Symbol object. This can save both time and memory."

    "> Ruby uses symbols, and maintains a Symbol Table to hold them. Symbols are names - names of instance variables, names of methods, names of classes. So if there is a method called `control_movie`, there is automatically a symbol `:control_movie`. Ruby's interpreted, so it keeps its Symbol Table handy at all times. You can find out what's on it at any given moment by calling `Symbol.all_symbols`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A symbol object is created by prefixing an operator, string, variable, constant, method, class, module name with a colon. The symbol object will be unique for each different name but does not refer to a particular instance of the name, for the duration of a program's execution. Thus, if `Fred` is a constant in one context, a method in another, and a class in a third, the Symbol `:Fred` will be the same object in all three contexts.\n",
