    "# Time Class in Ruby\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`Time`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.1/Time.html) class in Ruby has a powerful formatting function which can help you represent the time in a variety of ways. The `Time` class contains Ruby's interface to the set of time libraries written in C. Time zero for Ruby is the first second GMT of January 1, 1970.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ruby's `DateTime` class is superior to `Time` for astronomical and historical applications, but you can use `Time` for most everyday programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`strftime`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.1/Time.html#method-i-strftime) function is modelled after C's `printf`."
